# TR35: Business English II - Universidad Intercontinental

## Motivation

This course site represents a new approach to educational content delivery in the age of AI. Rather than fighting the reality that students increasingly use generative AI systems for tutoring and learning support, this project embraces it.

### Designing for Human and GAI Consumption

All instructional content is written in Markdown and made freely available for several key reasons:

- **GAI Integration Reality**: Students will copy course content into GAI systems regardless of format restrictions
- **Accessibility**: Information should be easily accessible to both humans reading on the web and GAI systems processing the content
- **Future-Proof Format**: Markdown ensures content remains readable and portable across platforms and time
- **Seamless Learning**: By providing content in GAI-friendly formats, we remove friction from the learning process

As Andrej Karpathy noted in his 2025 [Y Combinator talk](https://youtu.be/LCEmiRjPEtQ?si=mF66ukvERR6BPUc7), writing instructional content in Markdown is becoming a best practice. Instead of making information difficult to access through PDFs or complex display systems, this approach provides content optimized for interpretation by both humans and machines.

### Open Educational Philosophy

This project reflects a belief that educational barriers should be minimized. Students will find ways to access and use content with GAI assistance anyway—we might as well design the experience to be excellent for everyone and every system involved.
