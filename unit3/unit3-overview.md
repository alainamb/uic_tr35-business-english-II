# Unit 3: Production & Quality Processes

## Welcome

Welcome to the third unit of our class, which covers technical specifications, production processes, and quality management systems. This information will be very useful to you as you develop specialized translation and interpretation skills for manufacturing, operations, and quality assurance contexts, which are crucial areas in international business communications.

## Introduction

In this third unit of the course, you will analyze technical documentation, learn the terminology of production processes, and explore quality management frameworks. This module will prepare you to work with technical business documents that require precise translation and clear communication across language barriers.

## Unit Topics

During this unit, we'll cover these topics:

- **Specifications & Technical Documentation**
- **Production Processes & Operations Management**
- **Quality Management Systems** (PDCA cycles, root cause analysis)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you'll be able to:

- **Interpret and write technical specifications** using appropriate terminology and formats for international business contexts.

- **Describe production processes and operations** using precise English vocabulary and proper sequencing language.

- **Explain quality management concepts and methodologies** including PDCA cycles and root cause analysis techniques.

## Weekly Schedule

### [Week 7: Specifications & Technical Documentation](week7/week7-overview.md)
Focus on technical specifications structure and format, standardized terminology, and language precision in technical documentation.

### [Week 8: Production Processes & Project Management](week8/week8-overview.md)  
Production process terminology and workflow concepts, project management methodologies, and specialized vocabulary for project planning and execution.

### [Week 9: Quality Management Systems](week9/week9-overview.md)
Quality management terminology and concepts, PDCA cycle vocabulary, root cause analysis techniques, and quality documentation and reporting.

## Getting Started

Remember to participate in the face-to-face classes, complete the exercises, and submit activities on the platform. All of this will help you gather sufficient information to complete the final course project.

Each week builds upon the previous one, introducing increasingly specialized vocabulary and complex technical concepts that are essential for professional translation and interpretation in manufacturing and operations contexts.
