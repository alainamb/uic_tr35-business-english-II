## 1. Poise and Confidence When Presenting

**Voice and Pacing**
- Speak 10-15% slower than your normal conversation pace
- Use strategic pauses to emphasize important points

**Body Language That Commands Attention**
- Stand tall with shoulders back and feet shoulder-width apart
- Make eye contact with different sections of the audience
- Use purposeful gestures that support your message
- Move deliberatelyâ€”avoid pacing or swaying
- Keep hands visible (avoid pockets or behind back)

**Managing Your Space**
- Position yourself where everyone can see you clearly
- Use the presentation space confidentlyâ€”don't hide behind a podium
- Face your audience, not your slides
- Practice smooth transitions between points

**Professional Presence**
- Dress slightly more formally than your audience
- Eliminate filler words ("um," "uh," "like")
- Own your expertiseâ€”you know your content better than anyone in the room
- End strong with conviction and clear next steps

### Essential Viewing
- **[How to Make Stress Your Friend](https://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend)** by Kelly McGonigal via TEDGlobal 2013

### Reframing Your Relationship with Nerves

**Pre-Presentation Strategies**
- Thorough preparation reduces anxietyâ€”know your content inside and out
- Practice in conditions similar to your actual presentation
- Arrive early to familiarize yourself with the space and technology
- Focus on serving your audience, not on being judged by them

**Physical Techniques**
- Deep breathing exercises: 4 counts in, hold for 4, out for 6
- Light physical exercise or stretching before presenting
- Power posing for 2 minutes in private before going on stage
- Stay hydrated but avoid excessive caffeine

**Mental Reframing**
- Nervousness is excitementâ€”your body is preparing you to perform
- View mistakes as human moments that connect you with your audience
- Remember: the audience wants you to succeed
- Focus on your message and its value to the listeners

**During the Presentation**
- If you make a mistake, acknowledge it briefly and move forward
- Ground yourself by feeling your feet on the floor
- Use friendly faces in the audience as anchors for eye contact
- Remember to breathe between major points
