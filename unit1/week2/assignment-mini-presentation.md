- Use high-contrast colors and readable fonts
- Limit the number of words on the slide

**Delivery Preparation**

- Time your presentationâ€”aim for 6 minutes to allow buffer time
- Have a backup plan for technical difficulties

**Using Feedback**
- View rehearsal feedback as a gift that will improve your final product
- Don't take suggestions personallyâ€”focus on strengthening your message
- Make strategic changes that align with your presentation goals
