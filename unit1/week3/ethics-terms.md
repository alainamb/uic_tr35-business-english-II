## Activity: Building Your Ethics Vocabulary

### Step 1: Explore the Ethics Defined Resource

Visit the McCombs School of Business **[Ethics Defined](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/ethics-defined)** glossary, which features 2-minute videos that define over 50 terms related to ethics.

### Step 2: Select Your Terms

Choose **2-3 terms** that you find interesting or relevant to translation, localization, and interpretation work. Consider terms that might apply to situations you could encounter as a professional in the international language industry.

**Suggested categories to explore:**
- **Decision-making concepts:** Virtue Ethics, Bounded Ethicality, Consequentialism
- **Professional responsibility:** Cognitive Bias, Fiduciary Duty, Technological Somnambulism
- **Business practices:** Conflict of Interest, Self-Serving Bias, Ethical Fading
- **Cultural considerations:** Moral Relativism, Framing, Conformity Bias

### Step 3: Watch and Analyze

For each term you select:
1. **Watch the video** and take notes on the definition
2. **Consider the application:** How might this concept apply to language professionals?
3. **Think of examples:** What situations in translation/localization might involve this ethical concept?

### Step 4: Share Your Learning

**Post to Teams Ethics Discussion Channel:**

For each term you studied, provide:
- **Term and definition** in your own words (not copied from the video)
- **Professional application:** How this concept relates to translation, localization, or interpretation work
- **Example scenario:** A brief, hypothetical situation where this ethical concept might be relevant

**Note:** If a classmate has already posted about a term, choose a different one to ensure we cover a wide range of concepts.

## Reflection Questions

As you work through the terms, consider:

1. **Which ethical concepts seem most relevant to your future career in language services?**
2. **How do these formal ethical terms relate to informal ideas about "right and wrong" that you already hold?**
3. **What ethical challenges might be unique to professionals who work across languages and cultures?**

## Building Connections

Ethics in the language industry often involves:
- **Accuracy and fidelity:** Balancing literal translation with cultural appropriateness
- **Confidentiality:** Managing sensitive information across multiple parties
- **Professional competence:** Knowing when to accept or decline work based on your skills
- **Cultural sensitivity:** Navigating different ethical standards across cultures
- **Technology integration:** Considering the ethical implications of AI and machine translation

As you learn these formal terms, think about how they apply to these real-world professional contexts.
