**Key considerations:** Client relationship, accountability, solution-focused approach

### Scenario 2: Budget Increase Request
As a department head, you've discovered that your quarterly budget needs to increase by 15% due to rising material costs and expanded project scope. You must request additional funding from senior management.

**Key considerations:** Data-driven justification, cost-benefit analysis, timing sensitivity

### Scenario 3: Cross-Cultural Team Conflict Resolution
You're managing an international project team where communication styles have led to misunderstandings between team members in different countries. You need to address the situation diplomatically while establishing clearer communication protocols.

**Key considerations:** Cultural sensitivity, neutral tone, constructive solutions

### Scenario 4: Client Service Recovery
A major client has expressed dissatisfaction with your company's recent service delivery. Quality issues have affected their business operations, and they're considering switching to a competitor. You need to respond to their complaint email.

**Key considerations:** Accountability, service recovery, relationship preservation

### Scenario 5: Vendor Contract Renegotiation

**Key considerations:** Negotiation strategy, mutual benefit, professional assertiveness

### Scenario 6: Internal Process Change Announcement
