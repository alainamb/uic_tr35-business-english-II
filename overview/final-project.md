# Final Project: Show & Tell Integration

The objective of the final project is to demonstrate your comprehensive mastery of business English through a "Show and Tell" approach that simulates authentic business communication practices. You will showcase your ability to convey complex business information through both visual presentations and written reports, mirroring the dual communication modes frequently required in professional environments.

## The Show and Tell Approach

### The "Show" Component: Business Presentation

In the business world, your ability to deliver concise, visually compelling presentations often determines project approval, client acquisition, and leadership recognition. The "Show" component of this project simulates situations where you must:

- Capture attention through visual storytelling
- Distill complex information into accessible key points
- Communicate with confidence and clarity
- Engage an audience that may have limited time and diverse knowledge levels

Your presentation slides and recorded delivery should demonstrate these critical business skills, showcasing your ability to communicate effectively in a time-constrained environment where first impressions matter.

### The "Tell" Component: Comprehensive Report

While presentations drive initial interest, detailed reports provide the substantive information decision-makers need. The "Tell" component challenges you to:

- Develop an in-depth, well-researched analysis of your topic
- Structure information logically for different stakeholder needs
- Present data and supporting evidence professionally
- Demonstrate mastery of specialized business English terminology
- Create a professional document that could be circulated among departments

Your report serves as both proof of your research depth and as a reference document that stakeholders could consult for detailed information after being intrigued by your presentation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you'll be able to:

- **Create and deliver engaging business presentations ("Show")** that effectively communicate complex information through visual storytelling, concise messaging, and professional delivery techniques appropriate for executive audiences.

- **Produce comprehensive written business reports ("Tell")** that thoroughly analyze business topics using proper structure, advanced vocabulary, and appropriate citation methods that would meet professional industry standards.

- **Conduct meaningful peer evaluations** that demonstrate critical analysis skills, provide constructive feedback, and apply course concepts to assess both presentation effectiveness and report quality in business communications.

## Project Instructions

Working in groups of 3 students, you will select a contemporary business topic related to the course content, research it thoroughly, create a professional presentation, write a detailed report, record your presentation delivery, and evaluate presentations from your peers.

### Step 2: Research and Content Development (Weeks 14-15)
